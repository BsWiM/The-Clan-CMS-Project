Initial Commit from forked project: The-Clan-CMS-Project version 0.6.2

*** Changelog

SQUAD ROSTER MCV has been extended, removing the squad tag and replacing it with squad icons.

ARTICLES MCV has been extended, adding the article header functionality.

SHOUTBOX WIDGET and SHOUT MCV added.  The widget requires the SHOUT MCV in order to view shout history and permit admin moderation of shouts.

Install database creation has been modified to create the required changes necessary to validate with my extensions.


*** Important Notes

For those only looking to update certain files, use the files in /DB Tables to alter your existing database tables.

The Media GALLERY MCV is currently in alpha development and too embedded in current structer to remove the the purposes of this git commit.
